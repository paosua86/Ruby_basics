In the previous lesson, you learned about some really handy enumerable methods like #each, #map, and #select. In this lesson, we’re going to learn about even more enumerable methods! Woohoo! The party never ends here at The Odin Project!

This time, we’re focusing on a particular subset of enumerable methods: the predicate enumerable methods. You should recall from the Methods lesson that a predicate method is indicated by a question mark (?) at the end of the method name and returns either true or false. Again, we won’t be going through all of the predicate enumerable methods, so be sure to have a look at the Ruby docs to see what else Enumerable offers.
